# Text-Summarization

### Types of Text Summarization
There are two types of Text Summarization, one is Extractive Type and another one is Abstractive Type. Extractive summarization takes the original text and extracts information that is identical to it. In other words, rather than providing a unique summary based on the full content, it will rate each sentence in the document against all others, based on how well each line explains. On the other hand, abstractive seeks to construct a one-of-a-kind summary by learning the most significant points from the original text.

### The objective of Text Summarization
1. Extraction of useful information out of a huge amount of text.
2. Reduction of reading time.
3. Enable to read more articles as the time for reading each article will be reduced thus gather more information from different articles without losing much time.
4. Selecting articles allows one to process more information when reading because only the most significant aspects of the content are captured.
